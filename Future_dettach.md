Complete Guide: Convert Your Fork into an Independent Repo Without Losing Anything
This guide will detach your fork from the original (ItzCrazyKns/Levir-AI) while ensuring that: ✅ You keep all local files (including .venv, .env, and others).
✅ Docker Compose and Supabase continue working exactly as before.
✅ You keep working from the same VS Code setup with no interruptions.
✅ Your GitHub repo (aprada9/Levir-AI) becomes fully independent.

⚡ Step 1: Verify That Everything Works Before Changing Anything
Before making any changes, confirm that your project is running correctly:

sh
Copiar
Editar
docker-compose up --build  # Ensure everything builds and runs
If this works, move on.

🔗 Step 2: Remove the Fork Tracking
Inside your existing local repo, open a terminal and run:

sh
Copiar
Editar
git remote remove upstream  # Remove the link to the original repo
👉 This removes the tracking connection to ItzCrazyKns/Levir-AI but keeps your code untouched.

🚀 Step 3: Rename the Current Remote to Keep a Backup
Your origin currently points to the forked GitHub repo. Rename it as a backup:

sh
Copiar
Editar
git remote rename origin old-origin
👉 This ensures that if anything goes wrong, you can still access your original fork.

🌟 Step 4: Create a New GitHub Repository
Go to GitHub and create a new repository:
Create a new repository
Use the same name (Levir-AI) or another if preferred.
Keep it empty (no README, .gitignore, or license).
Copy the new repository URL (e.g., https://github.com/aprada9/Levir-AI-Standalone.git).
🔄 Step 5: Connect Your Local Repo to the New GitHub Repo
Now, add the new repository as the origin remote:

sh
Copiar
Editar
git remote add origin https://github.com/aprada9/Levir-AI.git
Then push your full repo:

sh
Copiar
Editar
git push -u origin main
👉 This ensures that your local files and history are safely backed up in the new repo.

✅ Step 6: Verify That Everything Still Works
1️⃣ Check the Git Remote Configuration
Run:

sh
Copiar
Editar
git remote -v
It should show:

perl
Copiar
Editar
origin  https://github.com/aprada9/Levir-AI.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/aprada9/Levir-AI.git (push)
If you still see old-origin, remove it:

sh
Copiar
Editar
git remote remove old-origin
2️⃣ Verify Docker Compose
Run:

sh
Copiar
Editar
docker-compose up --build
✅ If it works, your setup remains unchanged.

3️⃣ Verify Supabase Configuration
Check for any hardcoded repo references in your project:

sh
Copiar
Editar
grep -r "github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Levir-AI" .
✅ If nothing appears, Supabase is fine. If anything is found, update it manually.

🎯 Final Cleanup (Optional)
If everything works fine, you can now delete the original fork (aprada9/Levir-AI).
If you used a different repo name, rename it in GitHub > Settings to restore the original name.
🚀 Now You're Fully Independent!
✅ Your repo is now standalone (not a fork).
✅ Your VS Code setup, .venv, .env, and all local files remain untouched.
✅ You can now make the repo private.
✅ Docker Compose & Supabase continue working exactly as before.
